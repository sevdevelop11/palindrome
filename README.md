# Palindrome Checker

This repository contains a simple web application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to check if a word is a palindrome or not.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a word into the input field.
3. Click the "Check" button.
4. The application will indicate whether the entered word is a palindrome or not.

## Features

- **Palindrome Detection:** The application checks whether the entered word reads the same backward as forward.
- **Case-Insensitive:** Palindrome checking is case-insensitive, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters are treated the same.
- **Whitespace Handling:** The application ignores leading and trailing whitespace when checking for palindromes.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the user interface elements.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the palindrome checking logic.

## Controls

- Enter a word into the input field.
- Click the "Check" button to see if the word is a palindrome.

## Requirements

No additional requirements are needed to run this code apart from a web browser with JavaScript enabled.
